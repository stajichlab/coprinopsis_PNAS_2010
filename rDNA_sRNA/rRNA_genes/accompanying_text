Identification of ribosomal RNA genes

Nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes were identified based on comparison with highly similar ribosomal RNA sequences from Coniophora puteana (GenBank accession AM946631), Agrocybe aegerita (AAU54637) and Suillus sinuspaulianus (L47585), supplemented with predictions from RNAmmer and RFAM.
